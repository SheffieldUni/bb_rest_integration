Installation notes--to be expanded on. 
This is just very basic right now. 

1.) Make sure your system has the following installed: Python 3.5+, Apache 2, MariaDB, Redis. Ensure that Apache, MariaDB, and Redis are up and running as services. 

2.) Create a virtual environment in your chosen directory (e.g., /var/www/bb_rest_integration). 

3.) Activate your environment, then run "pip install -r requirements.txt" to get the needed Python libraries. 

4.) Git clone the repository into your directory.

5.) Run the bb_rest_integration.sql script in MariaDB to set up the database and tables that will log requests and errors. 

6.) Still in MariaDB, add a user that will have access to the logging tables (e.g., "bb_rest") on localhost and set up its password. (Optionally give it network access to enable use of graphical database tools such as HeidiSQL or DBeaver.)

7.) Edit config.py. Replace the following: 
	- BASE_URL hostname with your Blackboard hostname
	- OAUTH_CLIENT_ID and OAUTH_SECRET with your ID and secret from the Blackboard developer portal
	- user:pass in SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI with the username and password from the preceding step.
	- API_KEY with a secure value 

8.) If you're using Apache as your web server, install libapache2-mod-wsgi-py3 to enable serving Python scripts from Apache. (NB: Nginx + gunicorn should serve up Python scripts just as well, but I've only tested with Apache.) Also ensure that your site configuration file for this application includes the "WSGIPassAuthorization ON" setting--otherwise the API key check won't work. 

9.) TODO: Clear up setting up WSGI file. Configuring with a virtual environment's a little messy. Chuck it for single-purpose servers?
